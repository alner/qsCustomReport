### Self service without edit-mode for Qlik Sense!  

![Alt text](/screenshots/CustomReportSmaller.png?raw=true "Custom Report")

## Purpose and Description
In QlikView we saw a lot of users requesting a customizable straight table. Now that is possible in Qlik Sense too! The Custom Report extension allows you to create custom tables based on data in master tables. (For more info on customizable tables in QlikView, check out [this link](https://community.qlik.com/blogs/qlikviewdesignblog/2014/01/31/customizable-straight-table).)

First thing to do is create a table and make it a master item. The table is now accessible in Custom Report and you can select to show any or all measures and dimensions. Number format follows from the master item so no need to redo formatting! For full feature list see screenshots below.

Works only with Qlik Sense 3.0 and up!!

2. Select master item in the drop-down and choose what to show in the dimensions and measures. The custom table will be updated accordingly. Only dimensions and measures that are used will be calculated by Qlik Sense.https://community.qlik.com/blogs/qlikviewdesignblog/2014/01/31/customizable-straight-table

3. Sorting of columns by drag and drop.

4. The table used is a standard Qlik Sense table so all standard features such as export and sorting are available.

5. You can use tags in the master items to show only relevant master item tables. Choose your tag in the settings. (In the picture we used the tag "Custom report" but you can of course choose any tag you want.)

* If you don't like the colored dimensions and measures it is possible to make them colorless. There is also a default sorting option for the dimensions and measures.
